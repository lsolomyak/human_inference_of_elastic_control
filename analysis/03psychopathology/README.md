# Human Inference of Elastic Control - CCA and Permutation Tests

This repository contains the scripts and data for running the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), permutation tests, and figure generation for a project on human inference of elastic control. The scripts are designed to process questionnaire data and perform statistical analyses related to decision-making and emotional regulation.

### Key Functions

- **`run_basic_cca.R`**: This script will load the processed data and questionnaire scores, run the CCA, perform the permutation tests, and generate figures. 
  - **Outputs**: CCA results, permutation test results, and associated figures.
  
- **`cca_helper_functions.R`**: Contains helper functions to assist with the setup and execution of CCA.
  
- **`perm_helper_function.R`**: Contains helper functions specific to the permutation tests.
  
### Data

The data files located in the `data/processed` directory contain the questionnaire scores for each group.

- **`scores_group1_31_3_24.csv`**: Questionnaire scores for initial group
- **`scores_group2_31_3_24.csv`**: Questionnaire scores for replication group
